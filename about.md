In my free time, my main hobby is practicing jiu-jitsu and wrestling. I also enjoy reading. Some of my favorite science books are Hallucinations by Oliver Sacks and The Working Brain by Alexander Luria. 

### Research

I'm currently looking to apply to labs for PhD. My interests are in applying machine learning and computational modeling tools to further our understanding of the brain and neuropsychiatric disorders.
