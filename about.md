I'm currently looking to apply to labs for PhD. My interests are in neuroscience and psychology, specifically on research applied to neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, I am passionate about applying tools in machine learning and computational modeling to understand the brain. 

### Personal

In my free time, my main hobby is practicing jiu-jitsu and wrestling. I also enjoy reading. Some of my favorite science books are Hallucinations by Oliver Sacks and The Working Brain by Alexander Luria.
